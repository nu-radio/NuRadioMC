Utilities
============
*NuRadioReco* provides a number of utilities to make life easier, the most
important of which shall be introduced here.

Unit System
---------------------
To keep track of the units of the calculated event properties, *NuRadioReco*
offers its own units system. The usage is simple: For every input, the number
is multiplied by its units, for every output it is divided by it.

  .. code-block:: Python

    from NuRadioReco.utilities import units
    time = 132. * units.ms  # define 132 milli seconds
    d = 5. * units.mm   # define 5 mm
    v = d / time  # calculate speed
    print('The speed is {..2f} km/h'.format(v / (units.km / units.hour)))
    # the speed is 0.14 m / h

The advantage of this approach is, that the user does not need to worry about
(or even know) the units *NuRadioReco* uses internally. As long as all inputs
and outputs are multiplied and divided by the correct units, things will stay
consistent.

Fourier Transformation
--------------------------
Helper functions to perform fast Fourier Transform between time and frequency
domain. They can be found :mod:`here <NuRadioReco.utilities.fft>`. 
The functions are wrappers around the the numpy real Fourier transform
(since we know that signals are real in the time domain we can omit the negative
frequencies).
The spectrum is defined in volt/GHz instead of volt/bin, so that the values are
independent of the sampling rate.

.. Important:: Always use these helper functions when doing Fourier transformations.

Metaclasses
------------------------

Singleton
^^^^^^^^^^^^
For some classes (for example, the Detector class), it is usually a good idea to only have
one instance of it active at a time. This can be accomplished by assigning the Singleton
metaclass to it. The metaclass supercedes the __call__ method
(e.g. :code:`NuRadioReco.detector.detector.Detector()`) to check if an instance of the class
already exists and return that instance instead of creating a new one.

If you want to enforce the creation of a new class instance, you can overwrite this behavior
by passing create_new=True as a parameter to the __call__ method.
