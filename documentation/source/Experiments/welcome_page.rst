Experiment-specific features
============================

NuRadioMC (and NuRadioReco) are used by several different experiments.
To facilitate this, NuRadioReco contains several experiment-specific
features. Most of these are included under ``NuRadioReco.modules.<EXPERIMENT>``
for analysis features, and readers for the raw experiment data under
``NuRadioReco.modules.io.<EXPERIMENT>``.

More information about the features available for each experiment
are available on the pages below.
