HDF5 output structure (v2.2)
============================

.. Important::
  This version of the HDF5 output structure is outdated. To see the current HDF5 output structure, click :doc:`here</NuRadioMC/pages/HDF5_structure>`.

The output of a NuRadioMC simulation is saved in the HDF5 file format, as well as (optionally) in ``.nur`` files.
The data structure of ``.nur`` files is explained :doc:`here </NuRadioReco/pages/event_structure>`.
This page outlines the structure of the HDF5 files.

Opening the HDF5 file
---------------------
The HDF5 file can be opened using the ``h5py`` module:

.. code-block:: Python

    import h5py

    f = h5py.File("/path/to/hdf5_file", mode='r')
    attributes = f.attrs

    (...)
    f.close()

If you have many HDF5 files, for example because you ran a simulation parallelized over multiple energy bins,
NuRadioMC contains a convenience function to correctly merge these files -
see :ref:`here <NuRadioMC/pages/Manuals/running_on_a_cluster:4. Merge individual hdf5 output files>` for instructions.

What's behind the HDF5 files
----------------------------
The hdf5 file is created in NuRadioMC/simulation/simulation.py A list of vertices with different arrival direction
(zenith and azimuth) and energy is provided by the event generator. Starting from the vertex, several sub-showers are
created along the track. These are not simulated, but the electric field per sub-shower is provided. Sub-showers that
happen within a certain time interval arrive at the antenna simultaneous and interfere constructively, therefore,
they are summed up.

The ``event_group_id`` is the same for all showers that follow the same first interaction.
The ``shower_id`` is unique for every shower. Shower which interfere constructively are combined into one event and have
the same ``event_id`` starting from 0.

HDF5 structure
--------------
The HDF5 files can be thought of as a structured dictionary:

- The top level :ref:`attributes <NuRadioMC/pages/HDF5_structure:HDF5 file attributes>`, which can be accessed through ``f.attrs``, contain some top-level information about the simulation.
- The :ref:`individual keys <NuRadioMC/pages/HDF5_structure:HDF5 file contents>` contain some properties (energy, vertex, ...) for each stored event or shower.
- Finally, the ``station_<station_id>`` key contains slightly more detailed information (triggers, propagation times, amplitudes...) at the level of individual channels :ref:`for each station <NuRadioMC/pages/HDF5_structure:Station data>`.

HDF5 file attributes
____________________

* ``dt``

  the time resolution, i.e. the inverse of the sampling rate used for the simulation.
  This is not necessarily the same as the sampling rate of the simulated channels!

  list of the names of the different triggers simulated
* ``volume``

HDF5 file contents
__________________
The HDF5 file contains the following items. Listed are the ``key`` and the ``shape`` of
each HDF5 dataset, where ``n_events`` is the number of events in the file, ``n_showers``
is the number of showers (which may be larger than the number of events), and ``n_triggers``
is the number of different triggers simulated.

* ``azimuths``: (``n_events``,)
* ``energies``: (``n_events``,)
* ``event_group_ids``: (``n_events``,)
* ``flavors``: (``n_events``,)
* ``inelasticity``: (``n_events``,)

* ``shower_ids``: (``n_showers``,)
* ``shower_realization_ARZ``: (``n_showers``,)

  Which realization from the ARZ shower library was used for each shower (only if ARZ
  was used for signal generation).
* ``shower_type``: (``n_showers``,)
* ``triggered``: (``n_events``,)

  boolean; ``True`` if the event triggered on any trigger, ``False`` otherwise

Station data
____________
In addition, the HDF5 file contains a key for each station in the simulation.
The station contains more detailed information for each event that triggered it:
``n_events`` and ``n_shower`` refer to the number of events and showers that triggered the station.
The ``event_group_id`` is the same as in the global dictionary. Therefore you can check for one event with
an ``event_group_id`` which stations contain the same ``event_group_id`` and retrieve the information, which
station triggered, with which amplitude, etc. The same approach works for ``shower_id``.

* ``event_group_ids``: (``n_events``)
* ``event_group_id_per_shower'``: (``n_shower``)
  
  event group ids of the triggered events
* ``event_ids``: (``n_events``)
* ``event_id_per_shower``: (``n_shower``)
  
  the event ids of each event. These are unique only within each separate event group,
  and start from 0.
