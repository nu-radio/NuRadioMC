HDF5 output structure
=====================

The output of a NuRadioMC simulation is saved in the HDF5 file format, as well as (optionally) in ``.nur`` files.
The data structure of ``.nur`` files is explained :doc:`here </NuRadioReco/pages/event_structure>`.
This page outlines the structure of the HDF5 files v3.0. Find the structure of :doc:`v2.2 here </NuRadioMC/pages/HDF5_structures_history/HDF5_v2.2>`.


Opening the HDF5 file
---------------------
The HDF5 file can be opened using the ``h5py`` module:

.. code-block:: Python

    import h5py

    f = h5py.File("/path/to/hdf5_file", mode='r')
    attributes = f.attrs

    (...)
    f.close()

If you have many HDF5 files, for example because you ran a simulation parallelized over multiple energy bins,
NuRadioMC contains a convenience function to correctly merge these files -
see :ref:`here <NuRadioMC/pages/Manuals/running_on_a_cluster:4. Merge individual hdf5 output files>` for instructions.

What's behind the HDF5 files
----------------------------
The hdf5 file is created in NuRadioMC/simulation/simulation.py A list of vertices with different arrival direction
(zenith and azimuth) and energy is provided by the event generator. Starting from the vertex, several sub-showers are
created along the track. These are not simulated, but the electric field per sub-shower is provided. Sub-showers that
happen within a certain time interval arrive at the antenna simultaneous and interfere constructively, therefore,
they are summed up.

The ``event_group_id`` is the same for all showers that follow the same first interaction.
The ``shower_id`` is unique for every shower. Shower which interfere constructively are combined into one event and have
the same ``event_id`` starting from 0.

HDF5 structure
--------------
The HDF5 files can be thought of as a structured dictionary:

- The top level :ref:`attributes <NuRadioMC/pages/HDF5_structure:HDF5 file attributes>`, which can be accessed through ``f.attrs``, contain some top-level information about the simulation.
- The :ref:`individual keys <NuRadioMC/pages/HDF5_structure:HDF5 file contents>` contain some properties (energy, vertex, ...) for each stored event or shower.
- Finally, the ``station_<station_id>`` key contains slightly more detailed information (triggers, propagation times, amplitudes...) at the level of individual channels :ref:`for each station <NuRadioMC/pages/HDF5_structure:Station data>`. Each station group has its own attributes (``f[station_<station_id>].attrs``)

HDF5 file attributes

The top-level attributes can be accessed using ``f.attrs``. These contain:

The station-level attributes can be accessed using ``f[station_<station_id>].attrs``. The first two attributes ``Vrms`` and ``bandwidth`` also exist on the top-level and refer to the corresponding to the first station/channel pair.

HDF5 file contents
__________________
The HDF5 file contains the following items. Listed are the ``key`` and the ``shape`` of each HDF5 dataset, where ``n_events`` is the number of events stored in the file and ``n_showers``
is the number of showers (which may be larger than the number of events), and ``n_triggers`` is the number of different triggers simulated. Each "row" correspond to a particle shower which can produce radio emission.

            ``energies`` | (``n_showers``) | Energy of the parent particle of a shower.

            ``shower_energies`` | (``n_showers``) | Energy of the shower which is used to determine the radio emission
            ``flavors`` | (``n_showers``) | Same as above (the parent of an electromagnetic cascade in an electron CC interaction is the neutrino)

            ``multiple_triggers`` | (``n_showers``, ``n_triggers``) | Information which exact trigger fired each shower. The different triggers are specified in the attributes (``f.attrs["triggers"]``). The order of ``f.attrs["triggers"]`` matches that in ``multiple_triggers``
            ``triggered`` | (``n_showers``) | A boolean; ``True`` if any trigger fired for this shower, ``False`` otherwise
            ``trigger_times`` | (``n_showers``, ``n_triggers``) | The trigger times (relative to the first interaction) at which each shower triggered. If there are multiple stations, this will be the earliest trigger time.
            ``n_interaction`` | (``n_showers``) | Hierarchical counter for the number of showers per event (also accounts for showers which did not trigger and might not be saved)
            ``shower_ids`` | (``n_showers``) | Hierarchical counter for the number of triggered showers
            ``shower_realization_ARZ`` | (``n_showers``) | Which realization from the ARZ shower library was used for each shower (only if ARZ was used for signal generation).
            ``shower_type`` | (``n_showers``) | Type of the shower (so far we only have "em" and "had")
            ``weights`` | (``n_showers``) | Weight for the probability that the neutrino reached the interaction vertex taking into account the attenuation from the earth (Does not include interaction probability in the volume)


Station data
____________
In addition, the HDF5 file contains a key for each station in the simulation.
The station contains more detailed information for each station. Some parameters are per event and
some parameters are per shower. See https://doi.org/10.22323/1.395.1231 for a description of how showers relate to events.
``m_events`` and ``m_showers`` refer to the number of events and showers that triggered the station. NOTE: The simple table
structure of hdf5 files can not capture the complex relation between events and showers in all cases. Some fields can be ambiguous
(e.g. `trigger_times` that only lists the last trigger that a shower generated).
For more advanced analyses, please use the ``*.nur`` files.
The ``event_group_id`` is the same as in the global dictionary. Therefore you can check for one event with
an ``event_group_id`` which stations contain the same ``event_group_id`` and retrieve the information, which
station triggered, with which amplitude, etc. The same approach works for ``shower_id``.
