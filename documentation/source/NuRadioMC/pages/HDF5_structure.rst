HDF5 output structure
=====================

The output of a NuRadioMC simulation is saved in the HDF5 file format, as well as (optionally) in ``.nur`` files.
The data structure of ``.nur`` files is explained :doc:`here </NuRadioReco/pages/event_structure>`. 
This page outlines the structure of the HDF5 files.

Opening the HDF5 file
---------------------
The HDF5 file can be opened using the ``h5py`` module:

.. code-block:: Python

    import h5py

    f = h5py.File("/path/to/hdf5_file", mode='r')
    attributes = f.attrs

    (...)
    f.close()

If you have many HDF5 files, for example because you ran a simulation parallelized over multiple energy bins,
NuRadioMC contains a convenience function to correctly merge these files - 
see :ref:`here <NuRadioMC/pages/Manuals/running_on_a_cluster:4. Merge individual hdf5 output files>` for instructions.

HDF5 file attributes
--------------------
The top-level attributes can be accessed using ``f.attrs``. These contain:

* ``Emax``, ``Emin``
  
  maximum and minimum energy simulated
* ``NuRadioMC_EvtGen_version``, ``NuRadioMC_EvtGen_version_hash`` 
* ``NuRadioMC_version``, ``NuRadioMC_version_hash``
* ``Tnoise``
  
  (explicit) noise temperature used in simulation
* ``Vrms``
* ``area``
* ``bandwidth``
* ``config``
  
  the (yaml-style) config file used for the simulation
* ``deposited``
* ``detector``
  
  the (json-format) detector description used for the simulation
* ``dt``
  
  the time resolution, i.e. the inverse of the sampling rate used for the simulation.
  This is not necessarily the same as the sampling rate of the simulated channels!
* ``fiducial_rmax``, ``fiducial_rmin``, ``fiducial_zmax``, ``fiducial_zmin``
  
  Specify the simulated fiducial volume
* ``flavors``
  
  a list of particle flavors that were simulated, using the PDG convention.
* ``n_events``
  
  total number of events simulated (including those that did not trigger)
* ``n_samples``
* ``phimax``, ``phimin``
* ``rmax``, ``rmin``
* ``start_event_id``
  
  ``event_id`` of the first event in the file
* ``thetamax``, ``thetamin``
* ``trigger_names``
  
  list of the names of the different triggers simulated
* ``volume``
* ``zmax``, ``zmin``

HDF5 file contents
------------------
The HDF5 file contains the following items. Listed are the ``key`` and the ``shape`` of 
each HDF5 dataset, where ``n_events`` is the number of events in the file, ``n_showers``
is the number of showers (which may be larger than the number of events), and ``n_triggers``
is the number of different triggers simulated.

* ``azimuths``: (``n_events``,)
* ``energies``: (``n_events``,)
* ``event_group_ids``: (``n_events``,)

Station data
------------
In addition, the HDF5 file contains a key for each station in the simulation.
The station contains more detailed information for each event that triggered it:

* ``event_group_ids``: (``n_events``,)
  
  event group ids of the triggered events

  the event ids of each event. These are unique only within each separate event group,
  and start from 0.

  per shower and channel.

  The index of the trigger can be translated to the trigger name via the attribute ``trigger_names``.
* ``multiple_triggers_per_event``: (``n_events``, ``n_triggers``)
  
  a boolean array that specifies if each event fulfilled a certain trigger. 
  The index of the trigger can be translated to the trigger name via the attribute ``trigger_names``.
