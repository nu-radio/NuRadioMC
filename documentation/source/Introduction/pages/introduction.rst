Introduction
=======================================

Welcome to ``NuRadioMC``! NuRadioMC contains two packages - :doc:`NuRadioMC </NuRadioMC/pages/welcome_page>`
is used for Monte Carlo simulations of radio neutrino detectors, and :doc:`NuRadioReco </NuRadioReco/pages/welcome_page>`
is a reconstruction framework for radio detectors of high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays.

Please have a look at the documentation for each package in order to familiarize yourself with how to use NuRadioMC/NuRadioReco.
Some tutorials/examples can be found :doc:`here (NuRadioMC)</NuRadioMC/pages/manuals>` or
:doc:`here (NuRadioReco)</NuRadioReco/pages/howto_documentation>`. Additional examples are included as self-documented python
scripts in the ``examples`` or ``scripts`` subfolders of each module. Finally, you can check out the hands-on tutorial given in
our webinars: `NuRadioMC <https://www-zeuthen.desy.de/~anelles/NuRadioMC.mp4>`_,
`NuRadioReco <https://www-zeuthen.desy.de/~anelles/NuRadioReco.mp4>`_.

.. note::

    If you are looking for the examples that are included with NuRadioMC, and are using the ``pip`` version,
    you can use ``pip show nuradiomc`` in the command line, or ``from NuRadioMC import __path__ as nuradiomc_path`` to find the installation location.
