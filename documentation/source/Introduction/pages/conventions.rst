Some notes on conventions
=========================

Coordinates
-----------

Default coordinate system
_________________________
NuRadioMC uses a local cartesian coordinate system. 
The origin is at the surface, where the x axis is towards Easting, the y axis towards Northing, and the z axis upwards. 

Points
______
All points (e.g. antenna positions) are specified with respect to the coordinate origin. 
The position (0,0,0) is at the surface and x = 0, y = 0 is typically at the center of the station. 

Angles
______
The zenith/theta angle is defined with respect to z axis, i.e. 

* 0 deg = upwards
* 90deg = towards horizon
* 180 deg = downwards. 

The azimuth/phi angle is counting northwards from East.

Directions
__________

All direction are pointing to "where it came from", i.e. opposite to the direction of propagation. E.g. 

* 0 deg zenith angle = coming from above = propagating downwards
* 180 deg zenith angle = coming from below = propagating upwards (through the Earth)

Exception: The ``launch_vector``, the direction to which the Askaryan signal is emitted to reach the antenna, 
is defined into the direction of propagation. 

Units
-----
Physical quantities in ``NuRadioMC`` use Auger base units. To print, plot and convert dimensional quantities,
a convenient module is included in ``NuRadioReco``. Details are given :ref:`here <NuRadioReco/pages/utilities:Unit System>`.

Fourier transformations
-----------------------
To ensure Fourier transforms have the correct units, please use the convenience functions provided
in NuRadioReco detailed :ref:`here <NuRadioReco/pages/utilities:Fourier Transformation>`.
