        Simulates phased array trigger for each event.

        Several channels are phased by delaying their signals by an amount given
        by a pointing angle. Several pointing angles are possible in order to cover
        the sky. The array triggered_channels controls the channels that are phased,
        according to the angles phasing_angles.

        Parameters
        ----------
        evt: Event object
            Description of the current event
        station: Station object
            Description of the current station
        det: Detector object
            Description of the current detector
        Vrms: float
            RMS of the noise on a channel, used to automatically create the digitizer
            reference voltage. If set to None, tries to use reference voltage as defined
            int the detector description file.
        threshold: float
            threshold above (or below) a trigger is issued, absolute amplitude
        triggered_channels: array of ints
            channels ids of the channels that form the primary phasing array
            if None, all channels are taken
        trigger_name: string
            name for the trigger
        phasing_angles: array of float
            pointing angles for the primary beam
        set_not_triggered: bool (default False)
            If True, no trigger simulation will be performed and this trigger will be set to not_triggered
        ref_index: float (default 1.75)
            refractive index for beam forming
        trigger_adc: bool, (default True)
            If True, uses the ADC settings from the trigger. It must be specified in the
            detector file. See analogToDigitalConverter module for information
        clock_offset: float (default 0)
            Overall clock offset, for adc clock jitter reasons
        adc_output: string (default 'voltage')

            - 'voltage' to store the ADC output as discretised voltage trace
            - 'counts' to store the ADC output in ADC counts

        trigger_filter: array floats (default None)
            Freq. domain of the response to be applied to post-ADC traces
            Must be length for "MC freq"
        upsampling_factor: integer (default 1)
            Upsampling factor. The trace will be a upsampled to a
            sampling frequency int_factor times higher than the original one
            after conversion to digital
        window: int (default 32)
            Power integral window
            Units of ADC time ticks
        step: int (default 16)
            Time step in power integral. If equal to window, there is no time overlap
            in between neighboring integration windows.
            Units of ADC time ticks
        apply_digitization: bool (default True)
            Perform the quantization of the ADC. If set to true, should also set options
            `trigger_adc`, `adc_output`, `clock_offset`
