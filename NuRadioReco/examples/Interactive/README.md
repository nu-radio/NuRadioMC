# Interactive examples
This folder contains several interactive examples in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
They are split over the `NuRadioMC/examples/Interactive` and `NuRadioReco/examples/Interactive`
folders.

## NuRadioMC/examples/Interactive/W01-simulate-neutrino-detector.ipynb
Example to run a simple in-ice neutrino detector simulation.

## NuRadioMC/examples/Interactive/W02-reading-nur-files.ipynb
Example on how to read `.nur` files, and how the NuRadio `Event` structure works.
This example can be used with the output from the notebook above, but may also be
instructive for users who just want to understand the general NuRadio data structure.

## NuRadioReco/examples/Interactive/read_RNOG_data.ipynb
Example on how to read & process data from the RNO-G experiment.

## NuRadioReco/examples/Interactive/read_lofar_data.ipynb
Example on how to read & process data from LOFAR.
