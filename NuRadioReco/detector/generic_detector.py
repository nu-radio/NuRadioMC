    Used the same way as the main detector class, but works with incomplete
    detector descriptions.
    The user can define a default station. If any property is missing from one
    of the other station, the value from the default station will be used instead.
    If no channels are specified for a station, the channels from the default station
    will be used instead.
    For cases when the station design has a lot of channels, a default channel can
    also be defined. The default channel has to be part of the default station.
    It works the same way as the default station: Any property missing from one
    of the other channels will be taken from the default channel.
    The GenericDetector also ignores commission and decommision times and should
    therefore not be used for real data, but only for simulation studies.
    This detector only accepts json detector descriptions or dictionary.

            ID of the channel that should be used as the default channel. This channel has to be part of the default station and have a

            'json' or 'dictionary'
            default value is 'json'

            by json_filename will be used

        dictionary: dict
            If 'dictionary' is passed to the parameter source, the dictionary

        assume_inf : Bool
            Default to True, if true forces antenna madels to have infinite boundary conditions, otherwise the antenna madel will be determined by the station geometry.
        antenna_by_depth: bool (default True)
            if True the antenna model is determined automatically depending on the depth of the antenna. This is done by
            appending e.g. '_InfFirn' to the antenna model name.
