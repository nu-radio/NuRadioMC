The signalchain folder contains cable attenuation and RCU gains. The RCU gain contains the gain of the RCU in dB, one value for every frequency in the 30-80MHz band.
The cable attenuation files (one for each cable length) contain the frequency in MHz and the attenuation in dB (careful with the sign).
