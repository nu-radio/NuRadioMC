The signalchain folder contains cable attenuation and RCU gains. The RCU gain contains the gain of the RCU in dB, one value for every frequency in the 30-80MHz band.
The cable attenuation files (one for each cable length) contain the frequency in MHz and the attenuation in dB (careful with the sign).
The cable lengths for station 11, 28 and 201 are all set to 80.0 (careful here!) as the files containing their true lengths are missing. This will be changed as soon as the corresponding files are found.
