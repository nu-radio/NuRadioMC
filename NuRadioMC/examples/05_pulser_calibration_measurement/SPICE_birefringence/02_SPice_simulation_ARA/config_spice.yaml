noise: False  # specify if simulation should be run with or without noise
sampling_rate: 5.  # sampling rate in GHz used internally in the simulation. At the end the waveforms will be downsampled to the sampling rate specified in the detector description
  
speedup:
  minimum_weight_cut: 0 # disable neutrino weight cut -> we're not simulating neutrinos here
  delta_C_cut: 10  # more than 360deg, disable cone angle cut
  min_efield_amplitude: 0
  distance_cut: False

propagation:
  module: analytic
  ice_model: southpole_2015
  attenuation_model: SP1
  attenuate_ice: True # if True apply the frequency dependent attenuation due to propagating through ice. (Note: The 1/R amplitude scaling will be applied in either case.)
  n_freq: 25  # the number of frequencies where the attenuation length is calculated for. The remaining frequencies will be determined from a linear interpolation between the reference frequencies. The reference frequencies are equally spaced over the complet frequency range. 
  birefringence: True
  birefringence_propagation: 'analytical'
  birefringence_model: 'southpole_A'
  angle_to_iceflow: -131

signal:
  model: spherical
  zerosignal: False  # if True, the signal is set to zero. This is useful to study 'noise' only simulations
  polarization: custom # can be either 'auto' or 'custom'
  ePhi: 0.  # only used if 'polarization = custom', fraction of ePhi component, the eTheta component is eTheta = (1 - ePhi**2)**0.5
