These examples can be used to simulate a puler drop in the SPice hole with birefringence to a ARA or a ARIANNA station.
The examples should work out of the box by running A01 and A02 consecutively.

The ARIANNA simulation is based on staion 51 described here: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/15/09/P09039/pdf

The ARA simulation is based on staion ARA-5 described here: https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.123012
