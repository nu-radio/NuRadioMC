Welcome to ``NuRadioMC``! NuRadioMC contains two packages - :doc:`NuRadioMC </NuRadioMC/pages/welcome_page>`
is used for Monte Carlo simulations of radio neutrino detectors, and :doc:`NuRadioReco </NuRadioReco/pages/welcome_page>`
is a reconstruction framework for radio detectors of high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays.

If you are new to ``NuRadioMC``, have a look at the :doc:`How to get started </Introduction/pages/quickstart>` to see how to get started.
You can also find many annotated examples that illustrate how to use the code in the ``NuRadioMC/examples`` and ``NuRadioReco/examples``
folders in the source code. Extensive documentation of the different features of NuRadioMC can be found
:doc:`here (NuRadioMC)</NuRadioMC/pages/manuals>` or :doc:`here (NuRadioReco)</NuRadioReco/pages/howto_documentation>` .
You can also watch the hands-on tutorial given in
our webinars: `NuRadioMC <https://www-zeuthen.desy.de/~anelles/NuRadioMC.mp4>`__,
`NuRadioReco <https://www-zeuthen.desy.de/~anelles/NuRadioReco.mp4>`__.

.. note::

    If you are looking for the examples that are included with NuRadioMC,
    you can use ``pip show nuradiomc`` in the command line, or ``from NuRadioMC import __path__ as nuradiomc_path`` to find the installation location.
